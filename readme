1) Get Wrapper around wkhtmltox. Either P/Invoke or through command line
    DinkPDF or Pecbhkin great examples.

2) Because of the limitation by wkhtmltox with regards to conver and headings / footers we need to merge PDF's. Free PDF libs include PDFClown / PDFSharp



Header and footer sizes.

You can use dynamic header and footer size, but with the following limitations:
    -There is a small top and bottom margin about (0.15 cm)
    -You need to add a top margin manually if you want one
